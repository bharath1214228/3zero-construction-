The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg","altText":"Philosophy & Religion","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/95/180595-050-EDF2CA3A.jpg"}},{"id":9000,"title":"Politics, Law & Government","urlTitle":"Politics-Law-Government","description":"The world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.","image":{"id":0,"url":"/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg","altText":"Politics, Law & Government","fullUrl":"https://cdn.britannica.com/22/99622-050-E70BCD0A/Parthenon-Athens.jpg"}},{"id":1000,"title":"Science","urlTitle":"Science","description":"How can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science.

Ceramic <span id="ref664279"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/pottery" class="md-crosslink">pottery</a> had been developing in these cultures for some time, and the techniques of <span id="ref664281"></span><a href="../kiln-oven.html" class="md-crosslink">kiln</a>-firing were applied to bricks, which were made of the same clay. Because of their cost in labour and fuel, fired bricks were used at first only in areas of greater wear, such as pavements or the tops of walls subject to weathering. They were used not only in buildings but also to build sewers to drain wastewater from cities. It is in the roofs of these underground drains that the first surviving true <span id="ref664282"></span><a href="../arch-architecture.html" class="md-crosslink">arches</a> in brick are found, a humble beginning for what would become a major structural form. <span id="ref664283"></span><a href="../corbel-vault.html" class="md-crosslink">Corbel vaults</a> and domes made of limestone <a href="../rubble-masonry.html" class="md-crosslink autoxref">rubble</a> appeared at about the same time in Mesopotamian tombs (<span class="link-blue media-overlay-link asmref" data-href="/media/1/83859/799">Figure 1</span>). Corbel vaults are constructed of rows of <a href="../masonry.html" class="md-crosslink autoxref">masonry</a> placed so that each row projects slightly beyond the one below, the two opposite walls thus meeting at the top. The arch and the vault may have been used in the roofs and floors of other buildings, but no examples have survived from this period. The well-developed masonry technology of Mesopotamia was used to build large structures of great masses of brick, such as the temple at <span id="ref664284"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Tepe-Gawra" class="md-crosslink">Tepe Gawra</a> and the <span id="ref664288"></span><a href="../ziggurat.html" class="md-crosslink">ziggurats</a> at <span id="ref664285"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Ur" class="md-crosslink">Ur</a> and <span id="ref664287"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Borsippa" class="md-crosslink">Borsippa</a> (Birs Nimrud), which were up to 26 metres (87 feet) high.

It is a structure of somewhat curious and uncertain forms but of great elegance in execution and detail. It consists mostly of massive limestone walls that enclose a series of interior courtyards. The walls have <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="convoluted" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/convoluted" data-type="MW">convoluted</a> surfaces, which recall the mastaba tombs, with dummy doors, and there are even whole dummy buildings of solid stone. The complex has a large entrance hall with a roof supported by massive stone lintels that rest on rows of short wing walls projecting from the enclosing walls.

The complex also contains the first pyramid, created from successively smaller mastabas. All these elements are built of small stones, which could be handled by one or two men.

With these picks vertical channels as wide as a man were cut around rectangular blocks, exposing five faces. The final separation of the sixth face was accomplished by drilling rows of holes into the rock with metal bow drills. Wooden wedges were driven into the holes to fill them completely. The wedges were doused with water, which they absorbed and which caused them to expand, breaking the stone free from its bed. In the extraction of <span id="ref664307"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/igneous-rock" class="md-crosslink">igneous rock</a> such as <span id="ref664308"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/granite" class="md-crosslink">granite</a>, which is much harder and stronger than limestone, the mason’s pick was <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="supplemented" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/supplemented" data-type="EB">supplemented</a> by balls of dolerite weighing up to 5 kilograms, which were used to break the rock by beating and pounding.

There were no wheeled vehicles before 1500 <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>, and they were never widely used in building.

These tools remained standard until the 19th century. After the first appearance of small stones at Ṣaqqārah, their size began to increase until they attained the cyclopean scale usually associated with Egyptian masonry at about the time of the building of the <span id="ref664317"></span><a href="../pyramid-architecture.html" class="md-crosslink">pyramids</a>. In spite of the heavy loads that stone structures created, foundations were of a surprisingly shoddy and improvised character, made of small blocks of poor quality stone. Not until the 25th dynasty (<em>c.</em> 750–656 <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>) were important buildings placed on a below-grade (underground) platform of masonry several metres thick.</p><!--[P11]--><span class="marker p11"></span><!--[AM11]--><span class="marker AM11 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD11]--><span class="marker MOD11 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">The Egyptians possessed no lifting machinery to raise stones vertically. It is generally thought that the laying of successive <span id="ref664318"></span><a href="../course-brickwork.html" class="md-crosslink">courses</a> of masonry was accomplished with earth or mud brick ramps, over which the stones were dragged to their places in the walls by animal and human muscle power. Later, as the ramps were removed, they served as platforms for the masons to apply the final finishes to the stone surfaces. The remains of such ramps can still be seen at unfinished temples that were begun in the Ptolemaic period. The stones were usually laid with a bed of mortar made of gypsum, sand, and water, which perhaps acted more as a lubricant to push the stone into place than as a bonding agent. There was also limited use of metal <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="dovetail" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/dovetail" data-type="EB">dovetail</a> anchors between blocks.</p><!--[P12]--><span class="marker p12"></span><!--[AM12]--><span class="marker AM12 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD12]--><span class="marker MOD12 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">The <span id="ref664321"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pyramids-of-Giza" class="md-crosslink">great Pyramids</a> of <span id="ref664322"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pyramids-of-Giza" class="md-crosslink">Giza</a>, the tallest of which rose to a height of 147 metres (481 feet), are a marvelous technological achievement, and their visual impact is stunning even today; it was not until the 19th century that taller structures would be built. But they also represent a dead end in massive stone construction, which soon moved in the direction of lighter and more flexible stone frames and the creation of larger interior spaces. The free-standing stone column supporting stone beams appeared for the first time in the royal temples associated with the pyramids of about 2600 <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>. Square granite columns carrying heavy granite lintels spanned 3 to 4 metres (10 to 13 feet); the spaces between the lintels were roofed by massive granite slabs. In these structures the abstract <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="notion" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/notion" data-type="EB">notion</a> of the timber frames of the early royal buildings was translated into stone.</p><!--[P13]--><span class="marker p13"></span><!--[AM13]--><span class="marker AM13 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD13]--><span class="marker MOD13 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Although stone is more durable than timber, it is quite different in structural strength. Stone is much stronger in compression than timber but is weaker in tension. For this reason, stone works well for columns, which could be made very high—for example, 24 metres (80 feet) in the great <span id="ref664324"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Great-Temple-of-Amon" class="md-crosslink">temple of Amon-Re</a> at Karnak. But stone lintels spanning between columns are limited by the tension they develop on their bottom surfaces; their maximum span is perhaps 5 metres (16 feet). Thus, for longer spans, another structural form was needed to exploit the higher compressive strength of stone. But the arch, which could span a longer distance in compression, remained confined to the sewers and to the underground roofs of the tombs of minor officials. So, perhaps with the image of the timber building frame still strong in their minds, the Egyptian masons were content to explore the limitations of the <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="analogous" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analogous" data-type="MW">analogous</a> stone frame in a series of great temples built during the New Kingdom (1539–1075 <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>) at Karnak and Luxor, culminating in the elegant loggias of Queen Hatshepsut’s temple at <span id="ref664325"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Dayr-al-Bahri" class="md-crosslink">Dayr al-Baḥrī</a>.

In the Greek world of the Aegean and southern <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Italy" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Italy</a>, many stone-frame temples were built; some have survived to the present day in various states of preservation. They were built largely of local marble or limestone; there was no granite for huge monoliths. The basic technology was little changed from that of Egypt; the major difference was in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/labor-in-economics" class="md-crosslink autoxref">labour force</a>. There were no state-mobilized masses of unskilled workers to move huge stones; there were instead small groups of skilled masons who worked independently. The building accounts of the <span id="ref664326"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Parthenon" class="md-crosslink">Parthenon</a> show that each column was built under a separate <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/contract-law" class="md-crosslink autoxref">contract</a> with a master mason. There was certainly lifting machinery for handling the blocks, although its precise description is unknown; the concealed faces of stones still have grooves and holes that engaged the ropes used to lift them into place. Metal cramps and dowels were introduced for joining stones together; mortar was almost never used. There was some experimentation with iron <span id="ref664474"></span><a href="../beam-architecture.html" class="md-crosslink">beams</a> to <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="reinforce" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/reinforce" data-type="EB">reinforce</a> longer spans in stone, but the maximum remained about 5 to 6 metres (16 to 20 feet). Longer spans were achieved with timber beams supported by the stone frame; the solid stone roof slabs of the great Egyptian temples could not be duplicated.</p><!--[P15]--><span class="marker p15"></span><!--[AM15]--><span class="marker AM15 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD15]--><span class="marker MOD15 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Much of the mason’s effort was concentrated on the refinements of detail and optical corrections for which Greek architecture is justly famous.

Such drawings would normally have been erased during the final finishing of the wall surfaces, and those at Didyma survived because the temple was never completed. The drawings show how the masons developed the final profiles of columns and moldings—a rare glimpse of the design processes of builders before the days of pencil and paper.</p><!--[P16]--><span class="marker p16"></span><!--[AM16]--><span class="marker AM16 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD16]--><span class="marker MOD16 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">In contrast to stone technology, which remained largely unchanged from Egyptian methods, <span id="ref664505"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/clay-geology" class="md-crosslink">clay</a> masonry underwent considerable development. Although mud brick remained standard for dwellings, fired brick was more widely used and began to be laid with lime mortar, a technique borrowed from stone construction. Glazed brick also appeared in this period, particularly outside the Greek world among the <span id="ref664330"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Babylonia" class="md-crosslink">Babylonians</a> and <span id="ref664334"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Persian" class="md-crosslink">Persians</a>, who made considerable use of it in royal palaces. A fine surviving example is the <span id="ref664331"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ishtar-Gate" class="md-crosslink">Ishtar Gate</a> of the Palace of Nebuchadrezzar at Babylon, with a true arch spanning 7.5 metres (25 feet) and dated to 575 <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>. Another major <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off mw" data-term="innovation" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovation" data-type="MW">innovation</a> was the fired clay roof <span id="ref664332"></span><a href="../tile.html" class="md-crosslink">tile</a>. This was much more waterproof than thatch, and tile roofs could have the lower pitch characteristic of Greek temples. Hollow <span id="ref664333"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/terra-cotta" class="md-crosslink">terra-cotta</a> blocks for wall ornaments also appeared about this time, probably derived from the highly advanced pottery <a href="../industry.html" class="md-crosslink autoxref">industry</a>, which routinely made fired clay vessels more than one metre long.</p><!--[P17]--><span class="marker p17"></span><!--[AM17]--><span class="marker AM17 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD17]--><span class="marker MOD17 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Although stone technology remained confined to the trabeated (column-and-beam, or post-and-lintel) frame, there were a few structures that hinted at future developments. Perhaps the most spectacular building achievement of the age was the <span id="ref664335"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/lighthouse-of-Alexandria" class="md-crosslink">Pharos of Alexandria</a>, the great <a href="../lighthouse.html" class="md-crosslink autoxref">lighthouse</a> built for Ptolemy II in the 3rd century <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>. It was a huge stone tower nearly as high as the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Great-Pyramid-of-Giza" class="md-crosslink autoxref">Great Pyramid</a> but much smaller at the base—perhaps 30 metres (100 feet) square. Within this mass of masonry was a complex system of ramps over which pack animals carried fuel for the <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="beacon" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/beacon" data-type="EB">beacon</a> at the top. The Pharos was the first <a href="../high-rise-building.html" class="md-crosslink autoxref">high-rise building</a>, but the limitations of masonry structures and the lack of a rapid way of moving people vertically precluded any further development of tall buildings until the 19th century. The Pharos remained the only example of this type long after it was demolished by the Arabs beginning in the 7th century <span class="text-smallcaps">ce</span>.</p><!--[P18]--><span class="marker p18"></span><!--[AM18]--><span class="marker AM18 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD18]--><span class="marker MOD18 mod-inline"></span><p class="topic-paragraph">Another example of a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/ironstone-china" class="md-crosslink autoxref">new stone</a> technology that was tried but not pursued further by the Greeks was the underground tombs of <span id="ref664336"></span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mycenae" class="md-crosslink">Mycenae</a>, built about 1300 <span class="text-smallcaps">bce</span>. These tombs have main chambers enclosed by pointed domes of corbeled stone construction, about 14 metres (47 feet) in <a class="md-dictionary-link md-dictionary-tt-off eb" data-term="diameter" href="https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/diameter" data-type="EB">diameter</a> and 13 metres (43 feet) high. Crude versions of the corbel dome had appeared earlier in Mesopotamian tombs and the tholoi of Neolithic Europe, but in Mycenae the technics were refined and enlarged in scale. A corbel dome or arch does not develop the high compressive forces that characterize true arches and domes, which are built of radial segments of stone or brick. Thus it does not take full advantage of the great compressive strength of stone and cannot span long distances; 14 metres is near the upper limit. Greek masons did not choose to explore this type of structure; their buildings remained largely concerned with exterior forms. The Roman builders who followed them, however, exploited masonry to its full potential and created the first great interior spaces.</p><!--[P19]--><span class="marker p19"></span><!--[AM19]--><span class="marker AM19 am-inline"></span><!--[MOD19]--><span class="marker MOD19 mod-inline"></span></section><!--[END-OF-CONTENT]--><span class="marker end-of-content"></span><!--[AFTER-ARTICLE]--><span class="marker after-article"></span></div>
